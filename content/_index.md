Integrate eyeson into your own apps with our API and SDKs.  The eyeson API is
the foundation upon which all SDKs, frameworks, UI components and libraries
are built. The eyeson API offers direct control of eyeson CLOUD MCU instances
you can even compose video content in real-time.

A good place to start is the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/) that
will lead you through the basic concept and help you start your first video
call in a few simple steps.

Further control over broadcastings, recordings, presentations, screencapturing,
chats, layouts, image overlays, and others are documented in details in corresponding sections in the [API References](api-reference/)

During an eyeson room meeting session real time events are transported via
[Websocket events](websocket-events/).
